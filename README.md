# Dummy API

A super quick test API, to be implemented in Azure.

Challenges a user for an apikey, and rewards good, honest users with a cat picture. Mean liars that don't know the apikey get nothing but a sad face.

This is not secure by any means, so please don't try to use it to serve you cat pictures in production. There are (probably) other cat picture serving methods you should consider.
